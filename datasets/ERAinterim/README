Data downloaded from: http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim-full-daily/levtype=sfc/

Downloaded data with following options:

- instantaneous fields
        * parameters: 2 metre dew point temperature (d2m), 2 metre temperature (t2m), 10 metre U wind component (u10), 10 metre V wind component (v10), Surface pressure (sp)
        * times: 00:00, 06:00, 12:00 18:00
        * steps: 0

- accumulated fields
        * parameters: surface solar radiation downwards (ssrd), surface thermal radiation downwards (strd), total precipitation (tp)
        * times: 00:00, 12:00
        * steps: 6, 12

Original (downloaded) files are called: ERAi_instantaneous_6hourly_YEAR.nc or ERAi_accumulated_6hourly_YEAR.nc

Eventually need to split by year if multiple years were downloaded together:
cdo splityear ERAi_instantaneous_6hourly_YEARS.nc ERA_instantaneous_6hourly_

Merge instantaneous and accumulated fields:
cdo merge ERAi_instantaneous_6hourly_YEAR.nc ERAi_accumulated_6hourly_YEAR.nc ERA_params_YEAR.nc

############ THIS FOLDER CONTAINS: ################################################################

- prepared atmospheric forcing data to use in MITgcm

- main_loop.sh: loop over specified years, which calls *specHum_from_T_and_P.py* and *prepare_forcing_for_MITgcm.py*

- specHum_from_T_and_P.py: specHum_from_T_and_P.py calculates the specific humidity from the dew-point temperature and the surface pressure and includes the calculated variables into the NetCDF file. Start *specHum_from_T_and_P.py* directly or from main_loop.sh.
    usage: python specHum_from_T_and_P.py ERA_params_YEAR.nc

- prepare_forcing_for_MITgcm.py: Converts the NetCDF file to a binary file and flips the filed in y direction. Eventually converts the units of long- and shortwave radiation strd and ssrd from J/m^2 to W/m^2 and the precipitation from m to m/s.  Start from command line or main_loop.sh.
    usage: python prepare_forcing_for_MITgcm.py ERA_params_YEAR.nc '_ERAi_6hourly_YEAR' --convert --flip_y

- correct_precipitation.py: Correct precipitation forcing in order to reduce bias between modeled sea surface elevation and observations. Start from command line or main_loop.sh.
    usage: python correct_precipitation.py ERA_params_YEAR.nc 'tp_corrected_ERAi_6hourly_YEAR' --convert --flip_y


- folder *arctic_increase*: forcing data with increased temperatures over the arctic.
    Scripts to increase the temperature forcing.

- there is a bug in the 2016 wind fields (very high winds in time
record 603), and I replaced record 603 by record 602 (following
Claudia Wekerle's suggestion)

- extended forcing to Aug-31, 2019 (end of ERAinterim) with the help of
Claudia.Wekerle@awi.de, scripts: nc2bin.py, nc2bin_fluxes.py,
nc2bin_raw.py convert netcdf files in /work/ollie/clidyn/forcing/erai,
/work/ollie/clidyn/forcing/erai/raw, /work/ollie/cwekerly/erai/6_12 to
MITgcm binary ieee-be files

-note: tp_corrected are only valid for llc90 runs!
