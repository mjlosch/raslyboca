- CORE II IAF runoff forcing prepared to use in MITgcm downloaded from http://data1.gfdl.noaa.gov/~nnz/mom4/COREv2/data_IAF/CORRECTED/
- increased_runoff_arctic: runoff increased by 30% between 60 - 90 N

Scripts:
- loop_for_interpolating_to_MITgcm_llc_grid.sh: loop over years to interpolate/move runoff to llc grid
- move_runoff_to_MITgcm_llc_grid_points.py: move runoff on regular grid to nearest point on MITgcm llc grid
- move_points_to_ocean.py: move runoff lying on land to nearest ocean point
